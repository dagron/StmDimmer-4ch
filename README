MODBUS RTU support includes following function codes:

FC03 (read holding output registers) - registers 0..3 (unsigned 16 bit, 0..1023 values) contain PWM output values

FC04 (read input registers) - ADC data (unsigned 16 bit): 0 - input voltage (in mV), 1 - MCU supply voltage (in mV), 2 - MCU internal temperature sensor (in celsius, *100), 3 - Photoresistor 1 value, 4 - Photoresistor 2 (or Thermistor) value, 5 - ADC3 input voltage (1:5 divider, in mV), 6 - ADC5 input voltage (1:5 divider, in mV)

FC06 (write holding output register) - write PWM output value (see FC03), register with address 0x100 changes slave ID if it was set to 0xff (one time only, will require flash erase to reprogram!!!)

FC16 (write multiple holding output registers) - write PWM output values (see FC03)

Slave ID (in dimmer.h) is 0xf7. If you want to change it by FC06 write - set to 0xff
